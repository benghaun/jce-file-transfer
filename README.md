Implementation of secure file transfer through a network using the Java Cryptography Library (JCE).

It first verifies the identity of the server which it is uploading to by asking for its certificate, before encrypting the file data and transmitting it over the network.

1) Authenticate the identity of file server
2) Encrypt the file to keep data confidential.

This ensures security by having send to the correct identity and protect client from data leakage
